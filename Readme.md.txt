training.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook contains the code for training the pothole detection and classification model. It utilizes the images stored in the data/train/images directory as training images and the corresponding labels in the data/train/labels directory. You can modify the notebook to suit your specific training requirements.

UI.py: This Python script provides a user interface for interacting with the trained model. You can upload a pothole image through the UI and click on the "Predict" button to classify the pothole as either a manhole, puddle pothole, or regular pothole.

data/train/images: This directory contains the training images for the model. You should place your training images in this directory.

data/train/labels: This directory contains the labels corresponding to the training images. The labels should have the same names as the corresponding images, but with the appropriate class annotations (e.g., image1.jpg and image1.txt). Ensure that the labels are in a compatible format for your training algorithm.

data/valid/images: This directory contains validation images that can be used to evaluate the model's performance during training.

data/valid/labels: This directory contains the labels corresponding to the validation images.

data/test/images: This directory contains test images that can be used to evaluate the trained model's performance or test the user interface.

data/test/labels: This directory contains the labels corresponding to the test images.

models/best.pt: This file represents the trained model. Make sure to replace this file with your trained model named best.pt.

Usage
To use the Pothole Detection system, follow these steps:

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

Train your pothole detection and classification model using the provided training.ipynb notebook. Customize the notebook to suit your specific requirements and make use of the images and labels in the appropriate directories within the data/train and data/valid directories.

Once your model is trained, replace the existing best.pt file in the models directory with your trained model file named best.pt.

Launch the user interface by running the command python UI.py. This will start a local server hosting the UI.

Access the user interface through your web browser by navigating to http://localhost:5000. You will see an option to upload a pothole image. Select an image containing a pothole and click on the "Predict" button to classify it as a manhole, puddle pothole, or regular pothole.


Pothole Detection
Welcome to the Pothole Detection repository! This repository contains the necessary code and resources to detect and classify different types of potholes, such as manhole, puddle pothole, or regular pothole, in images. The detection and classification can be performed using the provided training notebook (training.ipynb) and the user interface (UI.py).

Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- training.ipynb
- UI.py
- data/
  - train/
    - images/
